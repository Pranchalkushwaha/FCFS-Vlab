# 1.1 FOCUS AREA:

#### To gain the maximum profit using 0/1 knapsack greedy algorithm

# 1.2 About the Experiment:
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

## 2.3 Description of sections:<br>

Let us consider that the capacity of the knapsack is W = 25 and the items are as shown in the following table.

| Item |	A	| B |	C	| D |
|------|---|---|---|---|
|Profit|	24 | 18 |	18	| 10 |
| Weight |	24	| 10	| 10	| 7 |

Without considering the profit per unit weight (pi/wi), if we apply Greedy approach to solve this problem, first item A will be selected as it will contribute maximum profit among all the elements.

After selecting item A, no more item will be selected. Hence, for this given set of items total profit is 24. Whereas, the optimal solution can be achieved by selecting items, B and C, where the total profit is 18 + 18 = 36.
