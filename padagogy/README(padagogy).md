#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept CPU Scheduling and they will learn how to determine its processing time through first come first serve algorithm and learn about its functionality of CPU and how the CPU works and its resource management.

#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the algorithm of FCFS. 
<br>
<div>
    The quizes are provided that will judge and inhance the skills of the Student.
    Each question is relevent to the experiment and justment to increse the understanding of experiment and their concept.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Arrival time and burst time | This will give the completion time through gantt chart,gives the turn around time ,waiting time as well as calculate the average waitimg time.
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of algorithm of student after using simulator.
